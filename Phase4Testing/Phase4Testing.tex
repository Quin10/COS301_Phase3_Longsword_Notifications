	\subsection{Pre-conditions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User details such as email address do exist and are valid.
		\item Notification request is complete with details of the email for example the subject and body of the email.
		\item The user receiving the email exists in the system
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Post-conditions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At least one notification has been sent to the appropriate user/users.
		\item System should log who Notifications are sent to, if the Notification request is not successful, the error message should be logged as well.
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{The Notifications services should only fail under Three conditions that are:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Request has failed to meet the validation criteria specified in the post conditions.
		\item The request information is incomplete or has an error.
		\item There actually is no notification for the user.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Team Broadsword Notification Services}
	For this section we inspected the code of the Team Broadsword email services.

\subsubsection{Create/Submit a Notification Request Through Browser} 
\paragraph{}Description : The HTML page accepts an email address and message which can then be submitted through a javascript function which retrieves the information entered and creates a notification request. The information is sent to this request object using a JSON string. This request is submitted using the "Post" method.
\paragraph{} Mark : 10

\subsubsection{Verify Email Address} 
\paragraph{}Description : The email address is not verified that it truly is a real email address, therefore for fake user emails, the code will produce exceptions. However these exception are somewhat accounted for.
\paragraph{} Mark : 4

\subsubsection{Handle Incoming Notification Request From Browser}
\paragraph{} The notification module does handle the incoming requests submitted from the browser using a python script.This script uses and SMTP server to send the email through to the supplied email address. The is no way of handling batch email requests however, so several email notification requests have to be created in order to mimic this batch functionality.
\paragraph{} Mark : 8

\subsubsection{Create Web Server To Handle Incoming Requests} 
\paragraph{} A notification HTTP server is created and implemented to handle all notification requests. This sever is implemented using a python script and once again makes use of SMTP.
\paragraph{} Mark : 10

\subsubsection{Log Notifications} 
\paragraph{} Description : The system does have a method to log the email notifications, this is done by saving he notifications request object.
\paragraph{} Mark : 10

\section{Evaluate the test cases of the previous team for non-functional requirements using your own criteria}	
		\subsection{Modularity}
			\paragraph{We felt that the broadsword notification team developed well written and modularized code. Each class has designed for a unique purpose and did nothing outside of that purpose. The functions themselves were not over complicated However they could have broken them up to into separate tasks.  \newline8/10}
		\subsection{In-code Comments}
			\paragraph{The comments for their implementation were decent however there were places were a comment could have been added or expanded upon. The classes themselves each have a description of what the classes are supposed to do but again were not explained upon. \newline6/10}
		\subsection{Capacity}
			\paragraph{The team implemented the ability to send a single a email however they didn't provide the ability to send batch emails. \newline6/10}
		\subsection{Error Handling}
		    \paragraph{The error handling was implemented very well with in their python script, which is the dominant language they used. Every error thrown was caught and handled such as unsupported http requests. Their java script, however, did not provided any error handling on some object creations. This could lead to the function ending unexpectedly. \newline7/10}
		\subsection{Use Cases}
