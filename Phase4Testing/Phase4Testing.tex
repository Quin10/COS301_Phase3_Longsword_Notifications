		\subsection{Modularity}
			\paragraph{We felt that the broadsword notification team developed well written and modularized code. Each class has designed for a unique purpose and did nothing outside of that purpose. The functions themselves were not over complicated However they could have broken them up to into separate tasks.  \newline8/10}
		\subsection{In-code Comments}
			\paragraph{The comments for their implementation were decent however there were places were a comment could have been added or expanded upon. The classes themselves each have a descrption of what the classes are supposed to do but again were not exapned upon. \newline6/10}
